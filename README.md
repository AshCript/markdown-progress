# Markdown Progress ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

Progress bars for markdown.

Have you ever wanted to track some progress in your markdown documents?
Well, I do, and I used `progressed.io` before but it was shutted down.

So I decided to recreate it.

## Usage

Add it as an image in your favorite markdown document, like this github readme, and change the progress number at the end.

> **Note**
> I'll try to keep this domain name up as much as possible, so wish me a long life üòÅ

### Custom colors?

If you want to customize the colors you can use this query params:

    dangerColor
    warningColor
    successColor

It will look like this:

    ![](https://geps.dev/progress/32?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)

And the results will look like this:


![](https://geps.dev/progress/10?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)

![](https://geps.dev/progress/50?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)

![](https://geps.dev/progress/75?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)

## Deploy

So if you want to host it and have your own domain, you can just deploy it on your preferred cloud.

It's straight forward for GCP but with some little changes you can do the same for any cloud since this is a simple function (or lambda).

### Google Cloud

Login and set the project in `gcloud` if you are not already logged in.

    gcloud auth login
    gcloud config set project THE_PROJECT_NAME

Deploy it as an HTTP Cloud Function with the `Progress` entrypoint.

    gcloud functions deploy progress --runtime go119 --entry-point Progress --trigger-http --memory 128MB --allow-unauthenticated

## Test it locally

Build the project so it downloads the dependencies

    go build

Run it

    go run cmd/main.go

You can visit the endpoint in your favorite browser, for example:

    http://localhost:8080/progress/76
