# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Exclude main library which is used to run it locally
cmd/

# Exclude go.sum since it's generated before running it on the cloud
go.sum

# Exclude README, editorconfig, etc to save some bytes
README.md
.editorconfig
